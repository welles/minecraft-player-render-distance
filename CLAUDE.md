# Notes for Claude

## Changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and must be updated for every
release:

- Add a `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section at the top (or rename `## [Unreleased]`) with `### Added` / `### Changed` /
  `### Fixed` / `### Removed`, describing the changes from a player's point of view, not commit by commit.
- Add the compare link at the bottom: `[x.y.z]: https://github.com/welles/minecraft-player-render-distance/compare/vPREVIOUS...vx.y.z`
  (for the first release: `[x.y.z]: https://github.com/welles/minecraft-player-render-distance/releases/tag/vx.y.z`).
- Commit the changelog before creating the release.

## CurseForge description

`CURSEFORGE_DESCRIPTION.md` is the text of the mod's CurseForge page, pasted there by hand. Keep it up to date: whenever
a change affects what players see (features, defaults, installation, requirements, supported versions), update it in
the same commit as the README and tell the user to paste it into CurseForge.

- The front matter holds the `summary`, the text CurseForge shows in its lists: catchy, for players, at most 256
  characters, with the hook in the first sentence. Everything below the front matter is the description.
- The description must always start with the prominent AI disclaimer (code, description and icon are AI-generated,
  why the author uses generative AI). Keep its wording the same in every mod.
- Write it for players: what the mod does, how to install it, what can be configured; no build instructions.
- Keep every paragraph and list item on a single line, since the CurseForge editor may turn line breaks into breaks.

## How it works

Three things keep a far player out of sight in vanilla, and the mod handles each:

1. The server only sends an entity within the view distance and while its chunk is loaded by the receiving player
   (`ChunkMap.TrackedEntity#updatePlayer`, `TrackedEntityMixin`).
2. The client only draws entities within the entity distance and in loaded, compiled chunk sections (`EntityMixin`,
   `LevelRendererMixin` / `LevelExtractorMixin` since 26.2), and the camera's far plane cuts off the rest
   (`GameRendererMixin` / `CameraMixin` since 26.1). Players are always ticked by the client, so they also move
   outside the loaded chunks.
3. Fog (and Distant Horizons' fade into its LODs) covers everything towards the edge of the render distance, entities
   included. Changing the fog for entities only is not practical (since 26.x terrain and entities share one render
   pass), so players beyond half the render distance are drawn closer and smaller by the same factor
   (`FarPlayers`, `EntityRenderDispatcherMixin`).

## Testing in multiplayer

The mod only does something with at least two players. `scripts/test-multiplayer.sh [node]` starts a local server and
two clients (Alice and Bob) that join it, each in its own directory under `run/test/`:

    nix-shell --run 'scripts/test-multiplayer.sh 1.21.11-fabric'

The server has a view distance of 4 chunks, so vanilla would lose the other player beyond 64 blocks and fog it out
even before; check distances of a few hundred blocks (`/tp`), with and without Distant Horizons and a zoom mod in
`run/test/<player>/mods` (they must match the node's Minecraft version). Start game instances with sound off
(`ALSOFT_DRIVERS=null`, master volume 0). For headless checks, unset `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` or GLFW opens the windows on
the user's Wayland desktop instead of the Xvfb display.

## Releases

1. Check that the `Build` workflow run of the latest commit on `main` is green. If a node fails while resolving
   dependencies (e.g. a POM from libraries.minecraft.net) although it builds locally, the GitHub Actions cache is
   probably broken: `gh cache delete --all -R welles/minecraft-player-render-distance`, then rerun the failed jobs.
2. Create the release with the changelog section as notes, followed by
   `**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/welles/minecraft-player-render-distance/compare/vPREVIOUS...vx.y.z`:
   `gh release create vx.y.z -R welles/minecraft-player-render-distance --target main --title x.y.z --notes-file <notes>`
3. Publishing the release runs `release.yml`, which builds every node with the version from the tag and attaches
   the jars. Check that all of them are attached. `mod.version` in the repo stays `0.0.0-dev`.
4. After attaching the jars, `release.yml` calls `curseforge.yml`, which uploads them to CurseForge with the changelog
   section, if the repository variable `CURSEFORGE_PROJECT_ID` and the secret `CURSEFORGE_TOKEN` are set. It can also
   be started by hand for an existing release: `gh workflow run curseforge.yml -R welles/minecraft-player-render-distance -f tag=vx.y.z`.
   Every run uploads new files, so do not run it twice for the same release. To finish an interrupted upload, upload
   only the missing jars with `-f files=<pattern>`, e.g. `-f 'files=*-neoforge-*'`. The repository variable
   `CURSEFORGE_ENVIRONMENTS` (default `Client Server`) sets the sides the mod runs on.

New features are a minor release, fixes only a patch release.
